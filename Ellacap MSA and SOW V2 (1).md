**Dated: August 8, 2025**

This Statement of Work is entered into as of **September 2, 2025 (the

subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "Buyer"), and **Omega Notes**,
("Vendor"), under the provisions of the Master Services Agreement dated

**Vendor Information**
**Name:** Omega Notes
**Contact:** Andrew Lang, Chief Executive Officer

Andrew.Lang@omeganotes.com \| 814.706.2884

**Statement of Work (SOW)**

The following scope and deliverables are defined for the *EQ Financial
Data Platform development project.*

**Project Overview**

Omega Notes will develop a financial data platform (codename **"EQ"**)
for Ellacap to streamline internal deal evaluation and portfolio
management. The platform will use **AI-powered insights** to capture,
process, and analyze financial documents.

The solution will be designed as a **single-organization MVP** with a
scalable technical foundation for future commercialization. The project
will be broken down into two primary phases, Feature Ready and
Production Ready.

**Core Technology Stack:**

- **Backend:** Python with Django REST Framework

- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PE-focused schema

- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript and professional UI components

- **AI Services:** OpenAI GPT-4 API, Azure Form Recognizer

- **Infrastructure:** Microsoft Azure (Blob Storage, App Service, Azure
  Database)

- **Authentication:** Azure Active Directory B2C

**Phase I: Feature(s) Ready (8--12 Weeks)**

This phase focuses on building the MVP foundation, enabling Ellacap to
upload and process financial documents with structured AI-driven
insights.

Phase 1 Discovery Efforts will define the foundational requirements for
EQ, a custom application supporting deal evaluation. The objective is to
capture a comprehensive understanding of current workflows, system
architecture, and functional needs to guide the design and development
of a scalable solution.

Key activities include:

- Business Process Mapping: Documenting core operational workflows,
  identifying pain points, and highlighting opportunities for
  automation.

- System & Integration Mapping: Cataloging existing systems and data
  flows, and identifying integration points with tools such as CRM,
  portfolio management, and compliance platforms.

- Wireframe Development: Translating workflows into low-fidelity
  wireframes of key application interfaces to ensure clarity and
  alignment with business needs.

Deliverables include process maps, systems and data flow diagrams,
wireframes, and a Discovery Summary with recommendations for
implementation. This ensures a shared understanding of the business
context, technical ecosystem, and application scope required to move
into design and development with confidence.

Any additional features or requirements that arise during Discovery
and/or are outside of the scope of this SOW will be subject to a
separate statement of work or change order.

This phase will be considered complete when the Vendor and Buyer
mutually agree on the following deliverables:

- Core MVP foundation with document ingestion and AI parsing.

- Financial data extraction (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash
  Flow).

- Secure file storage and version tracking.

- Basic data validation and export (Excel/CSV).

**Key Deliverables:**

1.  **Application Setup:**

    - Django backend with REST API.

    - PostgreSQL database schema tailored for private equity use cases.

    - React-based front-end with responsive UI for desktop/tablet.

    - User authentication and basic role management.

2.  **Document Upload & Processing:**

    - Drag-and-drop file upload (PDF, Excel).

    - Azure Form Recognizer OCR for document parsing.

    - OpenAI GPT-4 integration for financial data extraction.

    - Secure file storage in Azure Blob Storage.

3.  **Financial Data Extraction:**

    - Income Statement: Revenue, COGS, OPEX, EBITDA.

    - Balance Sheet: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Working Capital.

    - Cash Flow: Operating and Free Cash Flow.

    - Key PE Metrics: Multiples, margin analysis, growth rates.

4.  **Data Management & Validation:**

    - Data version tracking and audit trails.

    - Duplicate detection.

    - Export functionality (Excel, CSV).

**Limitations for Phase I (Out-of-Scope):**

- Single organization only (Ellacap).

- Basic trend analysis (no advanced forecasting).

- PDF/Excel only; no external integrations.

**Phase II: Production Ready (8--12 Weeks)**

This phase builds upon Phase I by adding robust analysis, reporting, and
multi-environment deployment to prepare for scalable use.

This phase will be considered complete when the Vendor and Buyer
mutually agree on the following deliverables:

- Full multitenant production environment with DevOps framework.

- Advanced dashboards and scenario modeling.

- Reporting tools for investment analysis.

- Enhanced AI-driven insights and performance optimizations.

**Key Deliverables:**

1.  **Financial Analysis Interface:**

    - Query interface for PE-focused KPIs (growth, margins, working
      capital).

    - Visual analytics with charts and saved templates.

2.  **Deal Evaluation Framework:**

    - Scenario planning (Base/Upside/Downside).

    - Simple 12-month forward projections.

    - Key ratio calculations (debt-to-equity, ROI).

    - Deal comparison across portfolio companies.

3.  **Reporting & Visualization:**

    - PE-focused dashboards and summary reports.

    - Trend visualization (revenue, margins, cash flow).

    - Exportable presentations for investment committees.

4.  **Production Environment:**

    - Full multi-tenant-ready architecture.

    - DevOps framework with single-instance updates.

    - Enhanced security, monitoring, and backup procedures.

**Limitations for Phase II (Out-of-Scope):**

- No complex financial modeling (DCF, LBO).

- No automated sensitivity analysis or market comparable.
